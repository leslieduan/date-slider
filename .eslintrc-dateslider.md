# ESLint Configuration Notes for DateSlider Component

## Expected Warnings

The DateSlider component intentionally uses patterns that trigger ESLint warnings. These are **NOT errors** and are acceptable for this complex layout-heavy component.

### React Hooks Warnings

**File: `DateSlider.tsx`, `TimeUnitSelection.tsx`**
- Rule: `react-hooks/refs`
- Reason: The component accesses refs during render for DOM measurement and layout calculations
- Why it's OK: This is necessary for precise positioning and scroll behavior

**File: `useFocusManagement.ts`**
- Rule: `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`
- Reason: State is set synchronously within an effect
- Why it's OK: This manages focus state in response to user interactions

### TypeScript Warnings

**File: `DateSlider.stories.tsx`**
- Rule: `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`
- Reason: Some story configurations use `any` type
- Why it's OK: Storybook internal types, doesn't affect production code

## Why Not Disable?

These warnings are kept visible (not disabled) because:
1. They serve as documentation of intentional patterns
2. They prevent accidental misuse of similar patterns elsewhere
3. The component works correctly despite the warnings
4. Disabling would hide legitimate issues if code changes

## CI/CD

The CI pipeline is configured to:
- Allow warnings (will not fail build)
- Fail only on errors
- This keeps the build green while maintaining visibility of intentional patterns

If you're working on DateSlider and see these warnings, you can safely ignore them.
